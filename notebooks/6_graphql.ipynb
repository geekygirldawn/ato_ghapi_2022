    "# Quick Intro to the GraphQL API\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros and cons of using the REST API and the GraphQL API with a simple GraphQL demo. I'm hoping this is enough to get you interested in learning more about the GraphQL API, but this is a super quick tour that will not show you what you need to actually use this API. It has a steeper learning curve and will take more time than what we have to really make it useful for you.\n",

    "REST API:\n",
    "* Pro: Easy to use\n",
    "* Con: Slow\n",
    "* Con: More frequently hit rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL API:\n",
    "* Pro: Gather more data without hitting rate limits\n",
    "* Pro: Faster\n",
    "* Con: Steeper learning curve\n",
    "\n",
    "[My example](https://github.com/geekygirldawn/project-api-metrics/tree/main/scripts): My repo activity script using the REST API took hours to run across 60+ GitHub orgs, but ran in less than 15 minutes when converted to GraphQL. I learned enough about GraphQL in an afternoon to convert the script from REST to the GraphQL API, so while it has a steeper learning curve, it's worth investing some time in it.\n",
