# [GitHub API 101 with Python and Jupyter Notebooks](https://2022.allthingsopen.org/sessions/github-api-101-with-python-and-jupyter-notebooks/)

This repo from my talk at [All Things Open (ATO)
2022](https://2022.allthingsopen.org/sessions/github-api-101-with-python-and-jupyter-notebooks/)
on November 2 in Raleigh from 2:45-3:30.

The content from the talk can be found in the notebooks directory. Those
Jupyter Notebooks contain all of the code from the talk and are numbered
based on the order that you are expected to go through them.

## Talk Abstract

The GitHub APIs are powerful tools for accessing data about your open source
projects, and they are easier to use than many people realize. While you can
perform data analysis that requires advanced skills, you can also gather some
very useful information quickly and easily with just a bit of knowledge about
the API and some basic Python programming skills. The talk assumes that audience
members have already installed and used Jupyter Notebooks and Python. Since this
is an introductory 101 talk, the focus will be on the GitHub REST API (v3), but
the GraphQL API (v4) will also be discussed.

This talk will use Jupyter Notebooks and Python to cover:

* Getting started: documentation, authentication, personal access tokens, and
  ethical use
* Demo: gathering data about users (employer, email, orgs, bio,
  type, …) 
* Demo: getting data about organizations (description, creation date, …)
* Demo: accessing data about repositories (last updated, open issues / PRs,
  license, …)
* Pros and cons of using the REST API and the GraphQL API with a
  simple GraphQL demo.

The audience will walk away with an understanding of how to use the GitHub API
to gather some basic information along with the link to a GitHub repository
containing the notebooks, demos, and other materials from the session.
